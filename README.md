# GeoCollector
## Hackathon 2022 Winning Project

This is the frontend part of the project that won first place at the Hackathon 2022, which took place on December 9th and 10th, 2022, at the State University in Novi Pazar. The goal of the project was to create a web application that would allow users to add points on the map of Novi Pazar where they can find: cultural and historical monuments, dining places, picnic spots, monuments, specific plants, and specific animals.

The frontend communicates with the [backend](https://github.com/tarikibrahimovic/Geo-CollectorAPI), which processes the user's uploaded images and determines one of the aforementioned categories based on the image content.
